# Dynamic-OD-Estimation-During-COVID
This is an official implementation of: Extending Dynamic Origin-Destination Estimation to Understand Traffic Patterns During
COVID-19

## Key Design
ðŸŒŸ Extended DODE model: We extend base DODE model by adding several additional regularizations terms to capture traffic behavior in a large-scale urban context.

ðŸŒŸ Urban road network: We construct the network along the highways to utilize the highway sensor information.

## Data
Highway traffic data is publicly available on [Performance Measurement System (PeMS) Data Source](https://pems.dot.ca.gov/)
Arterial road traffic data are subject to a non-disclosure policy.
